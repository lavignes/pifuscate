pifuscate 1.0 - A file encryptor/decryptor based on digits of pi.
usage:
pifuscate {encrypt|decrypt|--help} [Options] infile

Options:
-o <outfile>
	Outputs the pifuscate code to file <outfile>.
	By default the output will be stdout.
-k <key>
	Starts the pifuscation at index key.
	The key should be a number between 0 and 65535.
	The default is 314.
-i <iterations>
	Runs the algorithm <iterations> number of times. (More is slower)
	The default is 1.

Examples:
encrypting a file with the key 1337 25 times:

	pifuscate encrypt -k 1337 -i 25 file -o outfile

decrypting the same file and printing it on stdout:

	pifuscate decrypt -k 1337 -i 25 outfile
